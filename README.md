# Haberman-s-Survival-Data-Set-Description

Haberman's Survival Data Set Description : -
The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

Objective / Problem Statement
To Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in order to predict whether a patient undergoing surgery for breast cancer survives for more than 5 years or not based on the three attributes i.e age , year of operation and the number of positive axillary nodes detected.

Attribute Information:
Number of Instances: 306

Number of Attributes: 4 (including the class attribute i.e in our analysis the Survival rate )

Attribute Information:

Age of patient at time of operation (numerical) Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical) Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)

Survival_status_of_person (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer / 2 = the patient died within 5 year
